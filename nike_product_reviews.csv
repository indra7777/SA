GREAT WOROUT SHOE/ JUST NOT RUNNING,Overall Style is great from a  27 years old this with some nice cargo pants looks great. Great for in door Gym workouts. Not so great for running I did 5k and these were bad on the knees. But I would recommend for lifting weights. Overall very satisfied with my purchase.
runs small,"Be aware, runs half size small. but very good quality."
Oh ye-ah :),"Take it from someone who's literally owned hundreds of Nike shoes, these are ""SUPER"" comfortable shoes, lightweight, true to size, medium cushion...you can't go wrong with these very reasonably priced shoes ;)"
