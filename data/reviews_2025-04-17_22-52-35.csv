Better Experience 😝
Nice
Really very nice monitor.... felling good..
"delivery and packaging was good. Installation was easy for me, just followed what the manual said. As a budget gamer and avid film lover, i can say the colour is crisp, contrast is good. I know its not as good as sony or samsung panels! But for this kind of price range, its a perfect value for money monitor... I will update my long time user experience later!"
