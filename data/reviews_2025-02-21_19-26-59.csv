S25 ultra phone really marvelous and one of finest phone.. Everything is awesome of this smart phone..AL is mind blowing
Earlier I was planning to buy S24 ultra. After good deal I bought this one. Butter smooth performance. Excellent display. Only concern is battery.
Very good camera and photo editing features. Even it edits old photos of mine. Battery is ok. I am facing network issues sometimes even within the city limits where my earlier mobile worked good.
Good

Beast. Display is superb. Performance fast.
"Loved it, hands down better than iphone16pro max"
Crazy mobile must buy !!
This is the best overall phone right now . U can go for it without any hesitation..
Best AI future mobile looks more premium Then 16 pro max
"From a visual perspective, the S24 Ultra appears to be more premium. However, in terms of performance, it surpasses the S24 Ultra."
Best camera centric phone.
Very good phone
Go with it without  any second thoughts
"I love this product, I was planning for S24 ultra but I wait for S25 ultra and it's worth it"
Awesome üëå
"This phone is simply amazing! The battery life is great, the cameras are amazing, the display quality (especially the anti reflective coating) is tooo good. You even get 6 months of gemini advanced subscription for free.The only downside is the downgraded s-pen. If you're upgrading from an old cheaper phone then this phone is completely worth the upgrade, but if you already own an s23 or s24 ultra or equivalent device, i wouldn't recommend upgrading since most of the changes are very minor."
"Absolute beast, best display in the segment"
Excellent Phone! Absolutely butter smooth.Already loving it
Good one for business
Great phone.....

‚ù§Ô∏è üòç King in Smart phone...
"I couldn't get a 512GB deal because the phone was out of stock in 10 minutes for the same deal but can be purchased at a higher price, so I went with a 256GB deal which was a very good deal if not the best.Now coming back to S25 Ultra disappointed with the design, no doubt I liked the light weight but S 24 Ultra design was felt more premium, so design is minus for meDisplay as well as performance is top notch But the camera needs improvement in low light, The battery is good but we need a ..."
Fingerprint is not as expected.
Everything is good then 24 ultra and iphone pro series
"Whatever the expectations I'm not satisfied with the camera result. Because of this product may be improve some camera quality,Anybody, if you want to going to buy this product, you must. You should first priority on google pixel because of nobody can compare to camera quality to google pixel"
The s25 ultra is incredibly fast everything runs smoothly but the processor is only part of it one ui7 is better
"The Samsung S25 Ultra is a top-tier phone.  Upgrading from the S22 Ultra was worthwhile. The camera is significantly improved, especially the 5x portrait mode. It's also lighter and more comfortable to hold.  The selfie camera is better as well.  Many helpful AI features are included."
It's Good but not as expected. Fingerprint is not working properly.
Overall experience is awesome as of now and with few future updates it will be the best flagship. It is purely my opinion based on day to day usage.
Don't by from flipkart
"4 star because of fingerprint, its not so fast and need to try 2-3 time to unlock the phone"
"Product is good but it is widder than iphone 16 pro max, Camera is good but not accurate all the time like iphone. Overall in my opinion if you are iphone user don't switch to it."
Display is very good. camera is so good. Best And better flagship. Battery lasts full day with heavy use.
Excellent performanceStunning displayImpressive cameraLong lasting batteryPremium designAnd yesEnhanced AI featuresOverall the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra appears to be top tier flagship smartphone with a lot to offers.
Best phone Many time uses iPhone but first time use this Best phone
Perfect
"You will get eye irritation or othe eye related issues due to the low PWM, No Bluetooth in spen, charger rates are so costly, high cost for no improvement please go for one plus 13 or iPhone 16 or pro youget good phone in less cost."
Awesome üëå
Very good
The best Android phone ever.
Osm product just go for it
Ok
Camera is not good as expectedNight selfie camera is disgustingNight rear camera is also disgustingAccording to phone price is too much highWest of money
"Best android mobile in perfomance, however s23 ultra has more premium look than s24 ultra and s25 ultra"
Upgrading from s10 and its totally worth it.
Best
Superb phone. Samsung needs to work on spen and fingerprint scanner scanning
Awesome phone
Product seems to be flagship But model looks oldDisplay looks greatCameras to be improvedPremium category
Overall second best product after my iPhone XS. Good quality camera and the best part is the screen. But the price is on little bit higher. Overall a good product.
Noticed Heating issue while transferring data from my S9 to S25 using smartswitch and fingerprint is not responding properly. Disappointed a little
"Osamm camera and design, performance on top notch"
I hate the Ui and camera not even near to iPhone
Nice phone...no lag...
"Nothing special, camera was worst, when you want to take pictures with short distance the camera shows blurrr"
Design is not impressive.
Very very premium phone from trusted brand. Recommended to upgrade.
"Beat android phone in the market,  absolutely beast in all aspects.love the new s25 series."
Best flagship mobile phone
Fingerprint Not working properly
"Pre order this phone just after launch was waiting for it desperately.. I was a huge fan of oneplus but post merger oneplus is no more giving a pure Oxygen OS so I decided to move to Samsung and opted for Ultra... Since I got this phone I am in love with this from design to performance, camera to software experience everything is top notch beside all these flagship performance they added AI as cherry on top.... Samsung nail it in AI department, it work flawless and very useful in daily life....."
"This phone is a beast!Samsung dex is still rocking Samsung flow for other Samsung device runs soo smooth, didn't feel at all if I'm screensharing and controlling phone from tablet.Camera is bit better than last year's, all because of SoC SnapDragon 8 Elite. And the design is now feels handy, 24ultra felt a bit too big. This one feels like a phone, you would wanna use for anything.Tho the phone heat a bit when doing a bit heavy work but i guess its because of phone being new, also the he..."
If you're iPhone user please stay it. Don't try this... Face deduction worst at night or dim light finger print won't work after tempered glass... Heavy weight.. Too big display.. Hard to handle in one hand üñêÔ∏è..If you still want to buy go ahead... Saavu
Camera bump is too big. Selfie camera is very poor. It is best in s22 ultra. No Bluetooth  in s pen. Curved display is more premium.
"A beast mobile which can even be used as a personal laptop with Samsung Dex! When it comes to Camera and Performance, I don't think there is a competitor for this device! I really like the new curved edge design which makes it look more convenient. On the battery front, I feel it could have been done slightly better. I am getting some 4 hour screen on time with 27% battery left with last charged about 12 hours back. So I bought a Samsung original 25W charger just to see if that can make any d..."
Super...The Galaxy S25 Ultra is undoubtedly a wonderful phone .....
Just fantastic.
Asome Galaxy s25 ultra
Excellent android phone
"It's awesome, my first samsung device, I switched from iPhone and I think it is the best decision I made. Total value for money!"
Best in 2025
