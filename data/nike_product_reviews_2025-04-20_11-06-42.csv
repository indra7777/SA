Awesome trainers,"The trainers ticked all the boxes, they were awesome, BUT after watching loads of reviewers videos I ordered half a size bigger than my normal size only to find out that they were too big. If I had my correct size it would be 5 stars."
Something new and interesting,"Comfortable, stylish, and little different. Light weight good for exercising with style."
Very pleased with the Fit and Feel.,I use these shoes as a Law Enforcement Officer in the School. I walk around all day and sometimes take off running. Love these!  Very comfortable. I just haven't figured out how to tighten them up.
Nike Zoom Vomero Roam 9.5,"The shoes are absolutely comfortable the thickened sole provides great alleviation when running in and out of traumas. The toggle lacing system is state of the art along with the water repellent finish and mud guard make it feel like you're wearing a Gore-Tex sneaker. if you do like your sneakers, snug go with half size down. I  went with a  9 1/2  but put an extra insole to accommodate. Thank you, Nike for the beautiful shoes. #TeamNike"
Comfort for the everyday hustle,"Love the look, gonna buy more. Real fashionable colors , The assorted variety gives you  choice to mix and match"
Awesome Shoe,I suggest wearing a thicker sock the Nike Zoom Roam Men’s Winterized Shoe is great fit and super Comfortable. I was told by a Nike Customer Service Representative the shoe is unisex.
Lasted all weekend in the snowy mountains,Bought these shoes for a winter weekend up in the Colorado mountains. They were waterproof and kept my feet insulated from the wet snow all weekend (it snowed at least 6in per day). Add a pair of thermal socks and youre good to go.
Comfortable is the Word,Good and Comfortable!!True to size for me !!
Need them all!,Shoes are super comfortable. Glad I bought them. I also purchased the orange pair as well. Will purchase other colorways in the future.
Great Winter Shoe with Minor Fit Issues,"The Nike Zoom Vomero Roam Men’s Winterized Shoes are an excellent choice for winter conditions, with a few minor drawbacks.Starting with the fit and feel, the shoes feel snug and secure, especially with the adjustable toggle lace system, which is a nice touch for quick adjustments. However, they do run slightly narrow, so I recommend going up half a size if you plan to wear thicker socks during colder weather.The design is sleek and functional, with reflective details that are perfect for low-light conditions. The combination of textile and suede gives the shoes a premium look while maintaining durability. The rubber mudguard is a practical addition for keeping feet dry and debris-free.The fabric is top-notch, with a water-repellent finish that performed well during rainy and slushy conditions. The shoes are lightweight, which is impressive considering the added features for winterization.What I liked most about these shoes is the comfort provided by the Air Zoom units and foam midsole. They offer excellent cushioning for long walks or runs, even on uneven terrain. The traction on icy surfaces was also a standout feature.If there’s one thing I would change, it would be the narrow fit. It might not be ideal for everyone, especially those with wider feet. A slightly roomier toe box would make these shoes perfect.Overall, the Vomero Roam shoes have been a reliable companion for winter runs and walks. They keep my feet warm and dry while offering great comfort and style. Definitely recommend them for anyone looking for a versatile winter shoe!"
No Title,Amazing sneaker extremely comfortable worth every dollar! True to size I want every color
Amazing,I doubt it at first but it's really one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on. Be it in the office or the snow it just works. The winterized element in this roam is absolutely incredible. I love the lace feature and how the tabs around it helps with putting it on.
Love Them,"I love these and they are comfortable, Do not hesitate to purchase."
"Nike Zoom Vomero Roam, Men's Winterized Shoes",These Nike look good on the feet. They run a bit large I wear a 10 normally but these I had to change for a 1/2 size smaller.  Which fix perfect. They wear well a grip the floor great. I'm enjoying them.
No Title,Great shoe! Soles have great grip for walking on ice or on the mountain trails! Super comfy!
"Great shoe, but doesn’t fit my feet well","I’m surprised to find that I don’t love this shoe. It is very comfortable, however, the lacing system does not work for me, my heel slips no matter how tight I pull the toggle, but length, width feel great, so it’s not too big.  I’m also noticing my feet are rolling inward, slightly. I’m disappointed because the shoe feels great as far as comfort & support goes. The one time I’ve worn them it was rainy & icy and they kept my feel try. I’m going to try switching out the laces to see if that helps."
Best Winter Sneakers,These winterized sneakers feel like walking on clouds. Really comfortable and well constructed sneakers to withstand the cold weather.
Great winter shoe,"Great comfortable winter shoe. Its thick sole helps with slick conditions.  Waterproof is also great.  They are not extremely fitted, so not a great running shoe. But walking around in winter is awesome."
Perfect winter sneaker!,"Amazingly comfortable shoe and stylish too! They run a 1/2 size smaller due to the winterized rubber wrap around the toe and whole shoe. They stood up to a very cold and rainy two week trip to Paris and Milan. They’re like winter boots in sneaker form. The grip is also great on wet surfaces and the raised platform keeps your feet dry and warm in puddles. Also, the winterized rubber is easy to wipe clean (for those of us who hate dirty sneakers)!!!"
"Tough, Yet Comfortable",Very comfortable out the box!! Stood up to inclement weather in Paris for a week straight!! Highly recommended!!
Awesome shoe,I love this shoe.  I purchased the Summit White/Light Bone color and highly recommend it.  The shoe fits true to size for me.
No Title,I loved is a gift to my husband. He like
Comfy Vomeros,This is a beyond comfortable shoe. Very well put together and worth the buy.
L James,I weigh 250 lbs and my first visual inspection of these shoes I thought I would send them back but after trying them on and walking in them I was very impressed. So I wore them to a Cavs game where I walk a mile to the Arena  and these shoes didn't disappoint very comfortable simply some of  best shoes I have purchased not very good on the eyes but confront level is world class and I highly recommend
Nike Zoom Vomero Roam Men's Winterized Shoes,"I'm a big fan of the Vomeros and the Vomero Roam Men's Winterized Shoes didn't disappoint. Similar to the regular Vomero, these are super comfortable and the fit is true to size. I like how this version was made for wet weather and I don't have to worry about getting my feet wet. The rubber mudguard and layers of textile and suede on the upper was a different change. I also like how this shoe has a lace toggle so you don't have to worry about your shoe laces coming untied. The shoe is chunky but still felt light and not heavy at all."
Vomero roam,"These shoes are great. Not only are they stylish, they are super comfortable! They fit true to size and you can truly wear them all day. Because they are winterized, they keep your feet dry and warm which is great for winter time. The only downfall to them is the traction. Because you want to wear them during bad weather, I wish the traction was better to combat the elements. Other than that, these shoes are great!"
No Title,"I’ve been confused with quality of the shoe that I received , too much glue on the fabrics"
Quickly becoming my favorite shoe,"These shoes are some of the most impressive cold weather sneakers I’ve ever worn. The rubberized bottom does an impressive job at keeping your foot dry when walking through puddles, and the grip of the shoe is great for slippery conditions. I was a little nervous that the mesh top would get wet during rainy conditions, but I’ve been walking/biking through the rain in these for the last few weeks and my feet stay dry every time. They also do a great job keeping my toes warm in the cold. The laceless mechanism for tying them down is way faster and easier than traditional laces, so much so that it makes me wonder why I even bother with shoe laces in the first place. I wear a size 10 and they are true to size for me.They are tremendously comfortable, perhaps the most comfortable pair of shoes I own, which is also a huge plus, especially since most rain-resistant/waterproof shoes tend to be pretty uncomfortable after long walks/hikes in them.If I had one critique it would be that they aren’t the most stylish shoe, as I normally wear lower profile shoes myself. However, if you’re looking for a cold weather shoe that can hang in the rain, look no further than these."
Good but not great shoe.,Just got these shoes and after a few times wearing them I think they’re a good shoe. I like the overall look of them. Vomero’s are definitely in right now! I have the black/white colorway and I think they look good. I expected them to be a bit softer with the taller soles but they were actually kind of stiff. Decent comfort though. The only thing I would change is the pull strap to tighten the shoes. Not a big fan of that. Wish it were regular laces. Overall I like them and they look good!
A solid choice for a winter shoe.,"As someone who spends a lot of time outdoors, especially in colder weather, finding a reliable pair of winter shoes is a must. The Nike Zoom Vomero Roam Men's Winterized Shoes are an impressive option that combines modern style with functional performance.The fit of these shoes is spot on. They provide a snug yet comfortable feel right out of the box, without any uncomfortable tight spots. The sizing runs true, and the shoes feel secure without being overly constricting. Nike has designed these with winter conditions in mind, offering solid support, especially around the arch and ankle. Whether you’re walking, running, or just out for a casual stroll, they feel stable and comfortable. The cushioned sole adds to the overall comfort, offering a nice balance between softness and responsiveness.The Zoom Vomero Roam's design is sleek and modern, with a minimalist yet stylish look. The colorway and detailing give them a sharp, almost futuristic vibe. You can comfortably wear these shoes for a hike or a day in the city without feeling out of place. The mix of materials, like the textured upper and reflective accents, adds to the visual appeal. Nike has thought about making a shoe that doesn’t just perform well in harsh conditions but also looks great.The fabric is built to last. The upper material feels sturdy and seems designed to handle the elements, which is perfect for winter. The winterized design includes water-resistant features that help keep your feet dry, and the thicker, more durable construction suggests these shoes will hold up well over time. The boots have a nice balance of flexibility and structure, giving you the support you need without sacrificing comfort.One of the standout features of the Nike Zoom Vomero Roam is the excellent grip. The outsole is designed to tackle winter conditions, offering solid traction on slippery or uneven surfaces. Whether walking on snow, ice, or wet pavement, these shoes provide a secure footing that inspires confidence. This makes them a great option for anyone needing footwear that performs well in challenging weather.What I love most about these shoes is the balance between style and performance. They look great and feel comfortable but provide the durability and grip necessary for winter conditions. The extra attention to grip and weather-resistant materials makes them perfect for anyone needing a reliable winter shoe that doesn’t compromise aesthetics. They’re versatile enough for both outdoor activities and casual everyday wear.If I had to change one thing, it would be the weight. While the shoes are not overly heavy, they are slightly bulkier than some other running shoes or every day sneakers. This is to be expected, given their winterized nature, but I think a slightly lighter design would make them even more comfortable for all-day wear, especially if you’re walking long distances.Overall, the Nike Zoom Vomero Roam Men’s Winterized Shoes are a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a durable, stylish, and functional winter shoe. They have the right balance of comfort, performance, and design, making them an ideal pick for anyone who needs reliable footwear in colder months. Whether you’re braving the snow or just looking for a high-quality, long-lasting shoe for winter, these will not disappoint."
Boot in Disguise,"When my boyfriend first took these out of the box, he was surprised by how big and bulky they are. They feel super sturdy, and the traction on the soles will hold up well on snow and ice. The material is durable and water repellent, and looks like it can handle a lot of wear and tear. While my boyfriend likes the idea of a casual sneaker with the functionality of a winter boot, he doesn’t love the clunky design. The boosted look is dramatic, and the lace toggle is not his style preference. They also seem to run a tad small, but he hopes they will be fine after a short break in period. Maybe ordering a half size up is the way to go, especially if you plan on wearing thicker socks."
"Big Shoes, Little Compromise","When I initially received these shoes, I thought they seemed big. At a glance, the design of the shoe makes it seem larger than what it actually is. I didn't let my initial reaction deter the use of this shoe and I'm glad I didn't. First, this shoe is incredibly comfortable. I usually wear a size 10 and these were true to my usual size.I wore these casually throughout an average week of errands. They're easy to put on and take off. The shoes feature a non-traditional lace that's more of a bungee material with a stopper to save the lace settings. The shoes also repel water. On a very rainy day, these shoes kept my feet dry and did not absorb water like most of my sneakers would. I'm planning on taking these shoes with me on my Disney trip as I know they'll withstand walking all day and any threat of rainy weather.My only complaint is the overall look of the shoe. They are chunky, but I can get past it for how well these shoes were made."
Perfect for Comfort and Style!,"Nike has always impressed me with their versatile and thoughtful designs, and the Zoom Vomero Roam is no exception. These sneakers are super comfortable and fit true to size, which is a big plus. The design is especially perfect for colder weather, keeping my feet warm while looking stylish.The no-tie design is one of my favorite features. I love that I can just slip them on, and they fit snugly without having to worry about laces. It’s both convenient and secure! They pair perfectly with my Nike gear, making these sneakers a solid addition to my wardrobe. Highly recommend if you’re looking for comfort, style, and quality!"
All Weather-All Star!!,"All I can say is WOW! Living up in the northeast I’ve always had to be mindful of the weather around the fall. A cool breezy day at a festival could turn into a frigid night in an instant. Enter the Nike Zoom Vomero Roam- where fashion meets function. Since wearing them I haven’t had to worry about wearing a separate pair of boots on a rainy day and changing into something more comfortable when I get to work, it’s all there in one. The shoes give a supple cushion that reminds you that you’re still in sneakers yet a rigid confidence that you don’t have to worry about getting them dirty from mud or being soaked from the rain. I’m a big fan of the lacing system too, I like how I can adjust the fit on the fly. I think I’m actually most excited for when I can take my Vomero Roams out for their first snow fall to really push them too their limits. All in all I can confidently say, if you’re constantly having to check the weather forecast before deciding your KOTD- the Nike Zoom Vomero Roam makes your choice infinitely easier."
"Solid and supportive, with good grip in most conditions.","These shoes are great for stomping around town, they are weather resistant. Dirt and mud wipe away effortlessly from the uppers materials, which felt premium out of the box. The midsole is plush and structured while the outsole is robust and gives the feeling of having some traction on all terrains. Overall the fit is comfortable for standing and walking. However with extended walking, I noticed the shoes are so solid that my heel was not quite locked down in the back of the shoe and would come up while flexing my foot. The lacing system is different and unique. I like this kind of lacing system for a daily walk around shoe, but the fit is not adjustable enough for serious or extended physical activity."
Zoom Vomero are a Great Winter Alternative to Boots,"I haven't been able to test these out in the ice or snow yet, but they will be perfect for Minnesota winters. These will be a really nice alternative to winter boots.I love how easy they are to get on and off on. They are much more comfortable than my current winter boots. They have a nice design and are not as bulky as other winterized shoes. I can't wait to try these out in the coming winter months. They have great traction for shoveling the driveway."
Best Winter Shoe!,"Upon looking at the shoes, the design and colors stood out. The details of its shape define of being made for winter times. As soon as put the shoes on, they immediately felt comfortable and my feet were very relaxed in this shoe. I will say, the fit of this shoe run bigger than what I usually wear. As a size 9 Men’s, I could have possibly fit an 8.5 Men’s for this shoe. The design of this shoe was something I I really enjoyed, with the bulky soles and rubber hugged around the shoe, I know it’s very durable in harsh conditions in the winter time. The upper area with the laces provide a good amount of repellency to water which also showed the attention to detail. The toe area also provides security if you’re walking up hill and hit something with them. The lace technology impressed me as they are as simple as a pull to tighten and fasten it with its own laces, with the hook on the end of the lace. What I enjoyed the most about the shoe is its shape and colors. It has a subtle pop of orange on the bottom and in the back pull tab, with the bluish-gray and black overall color. Its shape gave me a sense of security for my foot due to the bulkiness. I know these shoes would help in the winter time with warmth, durability, traction, still have a cool trendy fashion look. Something I would change about this shoe would possibly be the laces. Although I do like them, overtime that can lose there stretch and be over stretched and you’ll have long laces with no where to hook them to. Overall, really impressive shoe, it’s rugged, it has a good fashionable look, and it will keep your feet warm during the winter time! If I were to rate it, I would give it a 9.5/10! I’m looking forward to styling this shoe and using in snowy/icey conditions!"
Perfect for winter,"I've been wearing these both for everyday wear & for the gym. Comfortable & true to size fit. The shoes are slip-on & provide a little extra height, they have great traction, perfect for the wetter weather. Would of normally have picked a solid dark color shoe, but the light grey sole with the reflective/ 3M has grown on me. The only downfall, I found my pinky toes on both shoes rubbed after wearing all day."
Great sneaker for winter weather,"The Zoom Vomero Roam is a running shoe that is winterized to keep your feet warm and dry in winter weather.  The shoes have a wider sole with pretty good grip, which should work well to keep from slipping on snow and ice.  They are also a bit heavier than some of the other Nike running shoes I have, but not too noticeable.  They seem to be pretty waterproof, but I haven't had a chance to wear them in snow or even rain yet.  These fit true to size, and I will most likely wear them work outside work around the house in snowy weather and for any athletic activity in snow."
Great look and comfortable,"I use these for casual wear. Great look and feel for casual street wear. Runs true to size, but will need some breaking in. My pinky toe rubbed against the side at first, but after a very short break in period, the rubbing went away. Loved that they were waterproof out of the box. A definite buy for those looking for a casual, everyday sneaker."
Comfort over style,"These shoes are very comfortable for everyday use. They have a solid heel and my foot feels very secure in them. The only thing I don’t really like about them is the style and color. It’s seems a bit odd to me. Of course this is just personal opinion, so if you’re into them, then I would definitely recommend them due to comfort alone. The other thing I do like about them is the lacing system. Very easy to tighten and secure."
Wouldn’t Recommend,"These shoes are giving me mixed emotions. The shoe has a narrow fit. It’s wide towards the back but squeezes my toes in the front. The shoe is very bulky and the sole extends slightly outwards which is a little off putting when walking compared to other Nike shoes. Aside from the shoe being narrow, the sole is comfortable and I like the lace technology used. It’s easy for me to slip these on and I don’t have to worry about them coming off throughout the day. I really like the colorway but the white used on some of the upper part of the shoe makes it look like the sole is a lot larger than it actually is. Unfortunately, this isn’t a shoe I can see myself wearing all the time."
Style meets functionality,"I was ecstatic to find out that the Nike Zoom Vomero came in a winterized version. The Nike Zoom Vomero is already known for its comfort, but making it winterized was the icing on the cake! It’s perfect for Michigan’s unpredictable weather, and I’m sure many people will find it useful in other parts of the country and world. I found the sizing to be true to size, with enough wiggle room for thicker socks. The rubber mudguard is perfect for navigating wet conditions and makes it easy to clean when dirty. The reflective laces, pull loop, and eyelets offer visibility when walking in low-light conditions. Overall, the Nike Zoom Vomero Roam Winterized is the perfect shoe for both comfort and unpredictable weather. I look forward to purchasing pairs in other colorways."
Surprisingly comfortable,"These shoes have it all. They look good, are comfortable and light but have good traction. The material on the outside feels durable, like it will last over time. They have some height to them too. The neutral colors go with everything."
Simply put.,Comfortable and easy to put on. Winter/weather ready. Needs a few more colorways. Don’t have to tie shoe which is cool. The fit is perfect.
Zoom vomero roam,"These have been my go to all day shoe! If you’re looking for all day comfort these are it. This shoe  has by far one of the best insoles I’ve experienced in quite some time. The toggle bungee lace system is so convenient, perfect for on the go. I like the added winterization great for fall to winter and winter to spring months. This shoe has a nice tread pattern similar to boots without adding the extra weight on your feet. It’s like having a hiker, winter boot and running shoe all in one. The material feels high quality and durable adding to the value. Can’t wait to see more color options for this shoe."
Nike Zoom Winterized Vomero Roam,Definitely runs small so get yourself a 1/2 size bigger. Material around the ankle is stiff wish Nike would’ve of put softer or more cushioning around the ankle. Other wise than that this a Great overall comfortable shoe. The Grip is insane on this shoe.
Winterized Vomero Roam,"I am definitely a fan of these shoes. The design of this shoe is so solid and is very functional. The oversized sole being rubber has been great for both keeping water and mud away and being easy to clean after wearing. I have used these shoes for multiple outdoor walks and hikes around water and in the rain and they have been great for that use. I have also worn these shoes on wet pavement and have felt stable with good grip from the tread under foot. Shoes are comfortable overall, but I did have to play with the lace toggle to get a good fit. I ended up having to have the toggle lace a bit more loose than I normally would with standard laces because the toggle lace seemed to cause the upper collar of the shoe to dig into the ankle/top of foot when at my normal lace tightness. I will get a lot of use out of these shoes and will be my go to for rainy days and outdoor walks/hikes that don’t require dedicated hiking boots."
Style & Comfort,"This shoe is perfect for colder weather. Not only are they comfortable, but they also have the Vomero 5 silhouette, which is a very good looking shoe. These shoes are very easy to put on and easy to secure on your feet. The soles have a ton of grip so you don’t have to worry when walking or running in wet conditions.  Overall just a great shoe."
Pleasantly surprised,"Fits true to size, reflective/3M detailing is a nice touch. Comfort level is very good and this particular colorway is nice although I prefer the monochromatic offerings. The lacing system was a bit confusing to me at first but once I figured it out I loved it."
Fits half size small,"I really like the shoes overall.  They do fit about a 1/2 small.  In Jordan 1's I wear a 10, ordered a 10 in these and the toe box is pretty narrow and short.  I'm going to return them and get a 10.5.The design is really nice and they give a good chunky/winter asthetic that I was looking for.  The details are good and I think Nike nailed it with this one.  Besides the narrow toe box and small fit, these are a win for me."
Disappointing,"Really disappointing, received a faulty pair having ordered at launch. Went for black colourway and the black material used on the sole clearly contained imperfections and flecks of white paint, which had set in the material before it was moulded.Impossible to remove, makes the shoe look shabby and for the price it’s very disappointing quality control from Nike"
