"Great phone. Love it. Everything is fine except for the exchange thing. Exchange guys, taking extra cash by just causing unnecessary trouble. They don't approve without paying extra cash to them. Flipkart should look into it."
"Much premium mobile , butter smooth touch display, Fantastic camera quality definitely beat iPhone 15 in the camera department.Lots to play with AI .Overall : 9/10"
"Everything is perfect except 3 things in the battery department.1.No charger.2.Slow charging.3.Small battery.I suggest Google to look into this matter seriously to upgrade in pixel 9 series to the present market trend, otherwise they will be fade out just like Nokia."
Superb ❤️❤️❤️❤️ thanks filpkart thanks Google
"It's been couple of weeks that I am using Pixel 8a.Camera is top notch 9.5/10Design wise it feels premium and lightweight compact smart phone. Thick bezels does't hamper the premium touch of the phone and user ability. So 8.5/10Screen brightness is 9.9/10. Using without an issue on broad daylight.Sound wise and haptics,, it does mind-blowing job just like an iPhone. Super duper impressed on this part. So 10/10.Battery wise..it's decent enough to use for whole day unless heavy gaming..."
"It's a decent phone with as usual good performance with normal usage but the charging seemed to be one of the concerns in its initial usage. It took a lot of time to charge at first with non-google chargers, even up to 3-4 hours which made me kind of regret buying this or think that I got a defective piece.

"This phone is a winner in terms of software, camera, design, and build quality. It boasts a premium look and feel, and the software delivers a fantastic user experience. However, the charging speed is on the slower side, so keep that in mind if fast charging is a priority for you"
"1. The camera captures great details, but other competing phones even 1-2 year old out performs it (tried moon photo, night astrophotography, old orange bulb, trees with sky). Could not impress anyone with the cameras. Tried comparing with iphone 14, and other motorola and xiaomi phones of similar price range from 1-2 years ago.2. Charging speed is extremely slow and this doesn't support a lot of charging adapters and cables. One has to properly find perfect cable and adapter permutation to ..."
Using it for almost 10days now. Super smooth display and touch. Camera is very good. Only problem is the battery longevity for heavy gamers. Perfect phone for anyone who likes a compact phone with superb camera quality.
Pixel 8a is a good phone but the charging is very slow  compared to other phones. The camera is very good. The UI is awesome. If you want to try a premium phone this is the phone to choose from.
