Software was a bit buggy (FIXED After update)Light usage phone Keeps up with day-to-day tasksBattery life's been great so far (4days)Camera is actually better than my poco F5Performance is as expected Love the designAlso the blue color has a nice gripOnly downside IN MY OPINION is it it would be a flat display and the cost is a lot to replace Also it can play MAX 1440p videos with stuttering in 4kGood enough for price thoOther than that it's a decent phone (I gave it to m...
Best in price range good camera good display overall good product
Here is my reviewFlipkart is charging 59 rs for secured packing but they did worst packaging they send the mobile in small box without bubble wrap or any protection. All features of mobile is good .battery backup is good but it take 1.30 hour to complete charge which is quite long but can be accepted .photo quality in daytime at natural sunlight is good by choosing 50 mp camera optionIndoor camera quality is average.phone look premium curved display is good fingerprint scanner is f...

"At this price range, the overall experience with this mobile is excellent.Camera - 09/10Battery - 09/10Display - 10/10Design - 10/10Performance - 09/10Clean UI experience, some unnecessary apps are there but the good thing is you can remove them if you want to. From my POV this is the best midrange phone for daily usage or for the students, go for it. Thanks to Motorola and Flipkart."
Initial impression very good. Just got the phone. I will further review after one week.
Camera quality super 😍❤️💚
"Great phone with excellent camera and display quality. Battery life is average, but my only major complaint is the absence of IP68 water and dust resistance. Otherwise, it's a top-notch device at this price point👍🏻."

"Nice product  good product  ,.................."
The phone is awesome and outstanding but Instead I would like to highlight some features that the phone lacks.1st there is no inbuilt app lock.2nd is there is no feature to show real time network speed or Internet speed.3rd  feature it lacks is auto switching 5G to 4G and vice versa.Let's see what they do in upcoming updates. Fingers crossed.If you are okay with itThen go ahead.
Good product for this price.
Average budget phone
"Aside from Flipkart's pathetic delivery that took three days to deliver the phone, having a curved screen plus Android 14 with Dolby Atmos support is something you won't find this in any other phone out there. Very lightweight, slim, and Moto had the good graces to include a 33W charger unlike the CMF phone.Moto G85 is currently the best phone in this segment for under 20K. If only Motorola had included a screen protector, it would've been a perfect package but alas this doesn't include it...."
"Decent device, Really awesome"
"Received this phone a week back.So far so good. Didnt get to test the camera extensively yet due to weather conditions not being favourable but as much as i have tested,looks promising. UI is clean except for some bloatwares which had to be manually uninstalled but thats fine. Only thing im missing in this phone is a dedicated gallery and a dialer app instead of the google apps the phone comes with. Nonetheless, solid phone for day to day basic usage(PS. i dont do gaming so the 6s gen3/695 is..."
The product is simply awesome 👍 👍 completely satisfied with the product
No 1 moto phone and good performance I love it🥰🥰
very slim and weightless. Unique design 👌🏻nice moto
"First Impressions: A Pleasant SurpriseMy initial experience with this mobile was highly positive. Both the front and rear cameras impressed me with their quality. There are no unnecessary apps cluttering the interface, giving it a clean, stock Android feel. The device operates smoothly, making it ideal for anyone seeking a mobile for photography and regular use. If camera performance and user-friendly operation are your priorities, this mobile is definitely worth considering."

Super photo quality and performance is good
"Clean and smooth UI, no lag.Beautiful curved design.Great camera both low light and outdoor pictures are good. Fast charging.The only thing that is disappointing is the battery.It's a 5000 mh battery, but feels like 2000. Doesn't last for half a day. Heats very quickly, drains very quickly. Don't buy if you are looking for a good battery backup mobile."

Best display and camera price segment
"Superb quality phone and camera ,just amazing 😍 I am very happy to buy this phone best quality phone under 18k."
"I don't know why everyone is praising this phone so much.It has the most average features at the given price point.The extra money is only for the curved screen rest of the features anyone can get at much lower price.I was very disappointed with camera quality.Software lags sometimes.Flipkart has given better reviews for this phone just to increase sale of this product, else for flat screen phone with better features you can get this in much lower price"
"I'm very impressed with the Moto G85 5G! The performance is smooth for everyday tasks, and the battery life is excellent, easily lasting a full day. The 50MP camera takes great photos, and the 5G connectivity is a huge plus. The clean Android experience is also a big win. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a budget-friendly 5G phone!"
"1.Battery is draining too fast. 2.Full charge is too late..3.Basic apps like file manager,galley also not provided. 4.Except that every thing is amazing.5. Camera and display is awesome.6.Phone is too lightweight,"
"This phone is only for parents and children, Not for Gaming ❌ multitasking❌,and continuous uses❌."
"Awesome camera smooth touch,,, very good product in this price"
Very good 👍 midrange mobile 📱 performance score 🎼 super
Phone is awesome. The display quality is outstanding with curved its look like a premium phone. Camera quality is average. Worth for money
Worth for money. Doesn't have any gallery. Both Camera quality is good. The battery life is also good. Performance can be better. A little bit of the heating issue is there at the start. Otherwise the phone is wonderful. Design is sexier
"Best camera,fast net speed,very good performanceBut battery performance bad"
"Phone is good and value for money.Flipkart is changing Handling and packaging fee, please be mindful of these charges"
Phone is pretty good in this price segmentCamera 5/5Battery 5/5Performance 4/5Display 5/5Audio Jack missing in this phone negative point for me apart from awesome phone🤟

Rear Camera outstanding.Front camera little bit disappointing.Battery backup very good.Performance Smooth.Moto g85 best in this price segment👌
"Camera is the biggest issue, it's autofocus in worst, 0.5x is useless. I hope it gets fixed in new updates.Rest the phone is as per my expectations. Good performance for my daily schedule."

Very very fast delivery in orderd 16 july 1pm recive mobile 11 am 17 julyOverall new Moto tg 85 thanks Flipkart this Mobile was performance of very good but charging slow but battery backup is two days camera is very good design good must buy
I really like this phone what a amazing curved display it have and it is very light weighted phone and the battery is amazing 5000mah and the mobile is very slim so I am curious how they fit this segment battery without making mobile so thicker and weighted
all feature is amazing
It's the best in this price range .. the display is excellent especially the edge display. The ui is smooth and effective no glitches observed. The battery is good and not draining so fast. If you are a normal user it will last long for a day and half for sure . And the Moto battery features are nice and help better to increase the battery life. And the Moto secure and Moto display features are best. Only con is that it won't support 4k recording and playing but that's okay if you are a regul...
I think if you are not looking for a gaming phone then it's a good one and if you are looking for a good camera and a good clean UI then I think on depend on that it's a 5 star and it's a targeted phone if you are not a gamer then it's good
Evey thing is fine with fantastic display.Smooth touch. But it has no inbuilt app even for message. There is no gallery app. Battery drains fast. SAR value 1.3. Motorola should give attention for such high SAR
